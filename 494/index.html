      <p><b>Custom Mechanic: </b>The Omnitrix from Ben10. This allows Link to transform into slain bosses and make use of their unique abilities.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Contributions:</b> For this custom level, I created the first three boss fights, movement and attack mechanics for 4 of the different player form mutations, and created half of the custom dungeon.</p>

      <p>And finally, <b>The Story of Draden</b></p>
      <br>
      <p>In this story book come to life, you play as Draden, a poor villager who was cursed into a small dragon. You and your town must survive three days of dangerous bandit raids as you await the completion of your human-potion. Your fate is in your hands- well, wings I suppose. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Contributions: I was responsible for the player movement and abilities, the upgrade shop system, the farming mechanics, sound design, and little bit of NPC AI. </p>
      <br>
      <p>This project was completed using C# scripting in Unity in collaboration with Azaan Lambki, Jack Kolbert, and Murphy Justian.</p>
